### Other

* [#1275](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/1275) Kafka server send group topic partition offset metric to prometheus. by @ZeDRoman in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3181
* [#2166](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/2166) Three new metrics have been added: `vectorized_storage_disk_total_bytes`, `vectorized_storage_disk_free_bytes`, `vectorized_storage_disk_free_space_alert`. More direct monitoring of Redpanda's disk usage and free space. A simple alert metric field `vectorized_storage_free_space_alert` which is non-zero when space is running low. Continuing improvements around full disk handling. by @ajfabbri in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3885
* [#2707](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/2707) Implemented simple metrics reporter. by @mmaslankaprv in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3066
* [#2876](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/2876) The minimum disk space allocation size is now configurable via the `segment_fallocation_step` property. The default is unchanged from the previous behavior (32MB). You may wish to decrease this property if creating large numbers of partitions on systems with limited disk space. by @ZeDRoman in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3288
* [#2987](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/2987) Add get transaction request to `admin_api`. by @VadimPlh in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3145
* [#3274](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3274) [#3337](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3337) Creating topics with larger partition counts is made safer, by validating that the cluster has sufficient resources to fulfill the request before trying to create partitions. New checks for sufficient RAM and sufficient file handles can be overridden if necessary with the new `topic_memory_per_partition` and `topic_fds_per_partition` settings respectively. The defaults are to require 1MB of RAM and 10 open file handles per partition. This functionality helps to avoid situations where a redpanda cluster can become unstable when the partitions created outstrip available system resources. by @jcsp in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3398
* [#3412](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3412) Memory utilization on systems with large number of partitions can now be tweaked using configuration properties storage_read_buffer_size (default 128KiB) and storage_read_readahead_count (default 10). These properties may be decreased to more conservative values such as buffer_size=16KiB, readahead_count=1 to reduce the per-partition memory overhead and improve stability when the number of partitions is large (e.g. more than 10000). by @jcsp in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3421
* [#3544](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3544) Implement `get_transaction` request for admin api. It returns information about all transactions. by @VadimPlh in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3659
* [#3544](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3544) [#3699](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3699) Add delete partition from transaction request. by @VadimPlh in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3661
* [#3688](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3688) Added new redpanda options: `rpc_server_connection_rate_limit` - Maximum connections per second for one core; `rpc_server_connection_rate_limit_overrides` - Overrides for specific ips for maximum connections per second for one core. (It should be array of strings like `['127.0.0.1:90', '50.20.1.1:40']`). by @VadimPlh in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3922
* [#3689](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3689) Added full support for leader epoch in Redpanda. by @mmaslankaprv in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3788
* [#3698](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3698) It is now possible to impose limits on the number of client connections. Cluster configuration properties `kafka_connections_max` and `kafka_connections_max_per_ip` are added to control this behavior. By default both properties are switched off (i.e. the connection count is unlimited). These limits apply on a per-node basis. Note that the number of connections is not exactly equal to the number of clients: clients typically open 2-3 connections each. by @jcsp in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3901
* [#3704](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3704) Redpanda upgrades are made more robust by tracking all node versions, such that new features can wait until all nodes are up to date before activating. by @jcsp in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/2938
* [#3704](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3704) The `v1/features` admin API endpoint is added, which can be used by automation scripts to query an internal logical cluster version, and feature flags for newly added functionality. by @jcsp in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/2938
* [#3751](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3751) The Redpanda Admin REST API now includes optional username/password authentication. This is in addition to the existing mTLS option, which remains available. To ensure backward compatibility for existing systems, username/password authentication is disabled by default, and may be enabled using the `admin_api_require_auth` cluster configuration property. The `enable_admin_api` configuration property is deprecated and will be ignored. The Admin API is now necessary for making subsequent Redpanda configuration changes, and security conscious users have the option to enable TLS&password authentication. by @jcsp in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3819
* [#3790](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3790) Introduces an optional field `preferredAddressType` to the cluster CRD. Allows to specify the preferred node address type to advertise for Kafka API when the subdomain is empty. by @dimitriscruz in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3794
* [#3892](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3892) Adds an option for configuring a bootstrapping load-balancer targeting the external Kafka API listener. by @dimitriscruz in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3896
* [#3991](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/3991) Added set of metrics to increase visibility of partition movement process. by @mmaslankaprv in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/4014
* [#4073](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/4073) Improves `rpk topic consume -o`, allowing consuming by time, and allows consuming to exit when the ends of partitions are reached. by @twmb in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/4091

When you upgrade Redpanda, your existing configuration will be imported automatically. Please consult the documentation for more detail on this feature. New rpk subcommands for handling cluster configuration: `rpk cluster config [edit|import|export|set|get|status|force-reset|lint]`. by @jcsp in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/3760
* Returning partition leader_epoch in record batches. by @mmaslankaprv in https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/4030
